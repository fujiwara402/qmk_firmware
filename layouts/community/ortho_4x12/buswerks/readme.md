Buswerks' 4x12 Ortholinear Layout
============================
For use on Planck, Let's Split, and similar keyboards

### Layout Overview

- Main Layer
	- An additional shift key is located on the right space key (only works for grid layouts)
	- Enter is located on the Raise key (layer-tap)
	- The left and right shift keys function as Space Cadet shift keys
	- The bottom left key is the Adjust modifier
	- Escape is in the traditional Caps Lock position
		- Holding down the escape key acts as LGUI (intended for macOS use)
- Lower
	- There is a numpad on the right hand (4, 5, and 6 are located under JKL/NEI/HTN)
	- Plus and minus keys are located to the right of the numpad
	- All other symbols are located on the other side of the keyboard, in a somewhat logical order
		- Symbols from the number row are in order, starting on the left pinky.
		- Equals and underscore are in easily accessible spots, because they are more commonly used in programming
		- The ampersand is less common, so it is moved to the right of the equals symbol
- Raise
	- Vim-style arrow keys
		- Above the arrow keys are media controls
		- Below are home, end, pgup, and pgdn
	- The left hand has all three types of braces
		- Curly braces are under the index and middle fingers for easy access during programming, and because parentheses are already available through Space Cadet shift
- Adjust
	- Function keys are located along the top row (reset is moved to accommodate this)
