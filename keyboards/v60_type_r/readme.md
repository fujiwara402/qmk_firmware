KBParadise V60 Type R 
======================

Released in 2017, the KBP V60 Type R is KB Paradise's first foray into the world of fully programmable keyboards. It utilizes an atmega32u4, Cherry MX switches, standard layout plate, Cherry style stabilizers, and plastic 60% case.  

The keyboard comes in two flavors:
1. V60 Type R
2. V60 Type R Polestar

The Polestar comes with both in switch and underglow lighting, while the regular Type R has neither.  

Please note that other variants of the KBP V60 are not fully programmable. 

In switch and underglow lighting is currently not supported, but the hex file generated by QMK can still be used for either type r board. 

The KB Paradise preferred way of creating the hex file is by using https://tkg.io/, selecting Fantastic60 and then defining your keymap.  

You will then have to use tkg-toolkit to finish the flashing
